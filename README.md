# Authentication-System
An authentication service built in Node

A fully functioning user login and registration system with access controls. Users can create their accounts, log in with their username and password and access the member's area.

USP: An extendible module that can be attached to any app that needs an authentication service.

MongoDB is used as a database, Passport JS for authentication, and bcrypt for password encryption.
